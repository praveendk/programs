6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
Conditions such as if else elif 
specific block of code will be executed If the condition is True 
specific block of code executes if the condition is False.
8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
#first block
if spam == 10:
  print('eggs')
#2nd block
if spam > 5:
   print('bacon')
#3rd block:
else:
  print('ham')
 print('spam')
print('spam')
9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is
stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
11. What is the difference between break and continue?
break - ones the condition becomes True, stops
continue - skips the condition and runs further
12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
range(10) = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
range(0, 10) = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
range(0, 10, 1) = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop.
Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using
a while loop.
#for loop
# printing numbers 1-10 using for loop
for x in range(11):
  print(x)


#while loop 
# printing numbers 1-10 using while loop
i = 1 
while i <11:
  print(i)
  i += 1
  if i == 11:
    break
14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how
